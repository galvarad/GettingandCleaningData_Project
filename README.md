# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This repository contains my work for the course project. 

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data used for this project is from wearable computing devices and was collected from he Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The full description of the data can be found here.

## Project Summary
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
